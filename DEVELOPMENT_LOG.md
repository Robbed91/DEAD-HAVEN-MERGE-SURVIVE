# Development log

This is the authoritative phase-by-phase record for Dead Haven: Merge &
Survive, per the project's working rules: work incrementally, keep the
project runnable after every phase, and report honestly at the end of
each one.

### Features completed

- Portrait Android export configuration (`export_presets.cfg`, `gl_compatibility` renderer, min SDK 28 / target SDK 34, no network permission)
- Main menu: New Game (with overwrite confirmation when a save exists), Continue (disabled with no save), Settings, Quit
- Scene navigation with fade transition and back-history stack (`SceneRouter`)
- Local JSON save/load: temp-file-then-rename writes, automatic `.bak` backup, corrupted-primary falls back to backup, debounced autosave on resource/setting changes plus save-on-pause/close
- Global `EventBus` signal hub for player resources, XP/level, scene changes, settings, toasts and save events
- `AudioManager` with Music/SFX buses wired to the volume settings; cues are named/keyed now but no audio files exist yet (tracked in `AUDIO_ASSET_GUIDE.md`) - missing cues warn once and no-op rather than crashing
- Responsive UI theme (`ThemeFactory`) implementing the palette, large touch targets, and a high-contrast variant; text-scale slider rebuilds it live
- Fully wired Settings screen: master/music/sfx volume, vibration, reduced motion, high contrast, colour-blind flag (stored, not yet consumed by any visual - see Known issues), subtitles flag (stored, not yet consumed - no dialogue system exists yet), text scale, reset progress (with confirmation), replay tutorial (honest "later phase" toast, no tutorial exists yet)
- Hidden developer diagnostics menu, debug-builds-only, reached by 5 taps on the main menu title; live FPS/scene/state display, working +energy/+coins/+level/reset-save actions, and honestly-disabled buttons (with phase-naming tooltips) for every system not yet built
- Placeholder screens for Haven (Hollow Creek Farmhouse exterior with 3 named but inert hotspots: front door, kitchen window, barn), the 7x9 Merge Board grid frame, the World Map (5 residence markers, 1 active/pulsing + 4 locked), and the Survivors roster (6 named cast members, Mara unlocked, 5 shown locked with a silhouette placeholder)
- All placeholder art is original and procedurally drawn in-engine (`Control._draw()`), not blank rectangles or generic circles, per the placeholder art policy - see `ART_ASSET_GUIDE.md`

### Tests performed

A Godot 4.3.stable Linux binary was downloaded and run headlessly against
the real project (no display server or Android SDK is available in this
container, so this is not the graphical editor and not an APK export):

- `godot4 --headless --path . --import` - clean project import, zero script/parse errors (one was found and fixed: `toast.gd` had a `:=` inference-from-Variant warning treated as an error under Godot 4.3's default strictness; changed to an explicit `bool` annotation)
- `tests/smoke_test.tscn` - instantiates Haven, Merge Board, World Map, Survivors, Settings and Dev Diagnostics in turn; all load and run `_ready()` with no errors
- `tests/smoke_test_save.tscn` - new game -> mutate resources -> save -> reload -> values round-trip correctly; primary save file corrupted on disk -> `SaveManager` recovers from `.bak` instead of crashing
- `tests/smoke_test_settings.tscn` - `GameManager.update_setting()` for volume/reduced-motion/high-contrast/text-scale is reflected in the real `AudioServer` bus volume and a rebuilt `Theme`'s font size

See `tests/README.md` for exact commands. This is real verification of
script correctness and core logic, but headless mode has no window - it
does **not** confirm visual layout, touch gestures, or animation feel on
an actual screen. `tests/PHASE1_MANUAL_CHECKLIST.md` covers what still
needs a real device or the editor's running game view.

### Known issues

- **Not visually confirmed.** Headless runs confirm the logic; nobody has looked at this on a real screen yet - see README "Honest limitation".
- `export_presets.cfg` was hand-written to Godot 4's known format rather than generated by the editor (no editor available here); if the Export dialog rejects it, delete it and let Godot regenerate the Android preset with the same package name/settings.
- Colour-blind mode and subtitles are stored settings with no visual/UI effect to attach to yet, because no colour-coded gameplay indicators or dialogue exist in Phase 1. They'll do something real starting Phase 2 (merge item rarity indicators) and Phase 4 (dialogue subtitles) respectively.
- The merge board screen currently shows the correct 7x9 empty grid and nothing else; this is the intended Phase 1 scope, not a bug.
- Single save slot only (matches the design spec's save-system requirements as written; multi-slot was not requested and was intentionally not added speculatively).

### Exact next phase

**Phase 2: Merge board** - grid drag-and-drop, merge rules (identical
item + identical item -> next level), producers with charges/cooldowns,
energy consumption tied to `GameManager.spend_energy()`, storage/inventory
transfer, tap-for-info and long-press-for-detail panels, task highlighting,
and the full merge/discovery animation set. Starts against the existing
`scenes/merge_board/` grid built this phase; will introduce the first
merge chain(s) with real `ItemDefinition` data under `data/items/`.

### Commands required to run or export the project

```bash
# Open and run in the editor
# (Godot 4.3+, standard build, GDScript-only project)
godot4 --path /path/to/dead-haven-merge-survive

# Headless import check (populates .godot/ cache, surfaces parse errors)
godot4 --headless --path /path/to/dead-haven-merge-survive --import

# Android export (after templates/SDK/keystore are configured in the editor)
godot4 --headless --path /path/to/dead-haven-merge-survive \
  --export-debug "Android" build/android/dead_haven.apk
```
